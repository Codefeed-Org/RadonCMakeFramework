# Radon CMake framework
![](https://travis-ci.org/Codefeed-Org/RadonCMakeFramework.svg?branch=master)
The Radon CMake Framework is a set of scripts to simplify tasks like generating libraries, executables, integrate them into other projects and contains a package management system to add external libraries and tools to your project.

## Why I should use it ?
The framework provides additional functions and macros to simplify the configuration and allows you to concentrate on your project instead of trying to get your cmake config running.
* easy to understand target configuration
* more features with less lines
* dependency propagation
* package management to add a external library or tool with a single line
* you only need a single short file and you're ready to go

## How I can use it ?
1. copy the [bootstrap file](https://github.com/Codefeed-Org/RadonCMakeFramework/blob/master/extern/Integrate.cmake) to your project
2. add `include("Integrate.cmake")` to your CMakeLists.txt
3. setup your project and benefit from the [Radon CMake API](https://codefeed-org.github.io/RadonCMakeFramework/)

## How I can support you ?
* Get in contact with me and help me to improve the project.
* Spend some money to hire technical writer, programmer and artists.
